# Passenger Counter

## Description

This is a simple web-based counter application built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. The app is designed to help users manually track and count the number of passengers boarding a train or any other public transport vehicle. It features a straightforward interface with controls to increment, decrement, and save the current passenger count. A history of previous saved counts is also displayed.

## Features

- **Increment:** A button to increase the passenger count.
- **Decrement:** A button to decrease the passenger count (in case of an error).
- **Save:** A button to log the current count and reset the tally for the next group of passengers.
- **Previous Entries:** Displays a record of past saved counts for quick reference.

## How to Use

1.  Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
2.  Click the "INCREMENT" button each time a passenger boards.
3.  If you make a mistake, click the "DECREMENT" button to correct the count.
4.  Once a group of passengers has boarded, click the "SAVE" button to record the entry. The count will then reset to 0.
5.  All saved entries will appear under the "Previous entries" heading.
